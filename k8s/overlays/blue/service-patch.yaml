metadata:
  name: todo-app # This name will be prefixed with 'blue-' by kustomization
spec:
  selector:
    # These labels must match the labels on the Pods created by the 'blue-todo-app' Deployment.
    # Kustomize adds commonLabels from the blue overlay's kustomization.yaml here.
    # So, if base deployment has app.kubernetes.io/instance: todo-app-instance
    # and blue overlay has commonLabels: {environment: blue, version: blue}
    # the selector here should reflect that the pods will have these combined labels.
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: todo-app-instance
    environment: blue # This label is added by the blue overlay's kustomization.yaml
